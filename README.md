# Building a Router
---------------------------------------
This week the assignment I chose was to build on the router.

# How to run
---------------------------------------
Download the code (everything except this file), and open it in VS code. Download an extension that allows for a local server to run (at least I had to do this) such as Live Server. When the download finishes, open up index.html in VS and click on the small button in the bottom right of the screen that says "Go Live".
